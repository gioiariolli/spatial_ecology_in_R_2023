# Something about me! 👩‍🎓
Hello everyone! My name is Gioia Riolli, a first year student in "Global Change Ecology and Development Sustainability Goals" at Unibo, a.a. 2023/2024.

+ Rock Climbing
+ Hiking
+ Playing guitar and ukuelele
+ Sometimes I practice yoga


## One curiosity about me
After my bachelor graduation, I took a gap year and I travelled with my best friend in SEA (Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos) for three months and a half. We volunteered in a buddhist meditation center in the suburbs of Bangkok and in a remote village in the middle of the Northern Vietnamese mountains. 
During this year I understood that my goals in life are to explore nature and to meet people and new cultures; that's why I've then decided to apply for this master: 
environmental monitoring in rural areas as a job? I'm in!
